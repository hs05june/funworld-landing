            For your safety and enjoyment at our Park, please carefully read all
            of the text below. Failure to follow any of the regulations,
            conditions and instructions set forth below may result in serious
            injury to yourself or other individuals. Individuals not following
            Park rules and safety instructions, will be subject to immediate
            ejection from the Park without refund.
        </li>

        <li>
          All guests must behave in a family-friendly, respectful, and courteous
          manner, and in a manner which is safe for themselves and for others.
          Violations may result in ejection from certain rides, attractions,
          areas of the Park, or from the Park itself, without refund or other
          compensation. They may also result in the Park contacting appropriate
          law enforcement authorities. The following is strictly prohibited,
          subjecting the violator to ejection without refund:

        <p>
          <strong>Fighting.</strong> The Park does not tolerate aggressive or
          threatening behavior. This includes fights (physical or verbal),
          challenges to fight or any threat thereof (whether to an intended
          victim or comments in general expressing a desire or intent to hurt
          another person), or any form of physical assault upon or intimidation
          of another person. You may also be ejected for any pushing, roughness,
          “chest bumping,” aggressive moves (e.g., clenching fists, getting
          face-to-face with another, getting into a fighting stance, etc.), or
          other physically aggressive conduct.

          <strong>Offensive Conduct.</strong> We run a family-friendly Park,
          where people should be civil courteous of one another. Prohibited
          conduct includes profanity, cursing, making offensive comments or
          gestures, pushing, spitting, flashing of body parts, and other
          offensive conduct.

        <p>
          <strong>Sexual Activity or Misconduct.</strong> Sexual activity, and
          displays of sexuality, are inappropriate for a family-friendly
          amusement Park. Guests may be asked to cease such activity and warned
          about the possibility of ejection, or they may be ejected without
          refund (in the Park’s discretion, depending on all factors). In the
          more offensive and graphic instances, the offending persons may be
          held for law enforcement. In any event of reported sexual misconduct,
          the Park may eject offending persons or hold them for law enforcement
          depending on all of the facts and circumstances of the alleged
          misconduct. In such instances, the alleged victims (or their
          parent/guardian, if they are minors) will be consulted on whether or
          not they want law enforcement involved. However, regardless of a
          parent/guardian’s wishes, the Park may nonetheless contact appropriate
          law enforcement authorities if the Park deems it advisable or is
          required to do so by law. If minors claim to have been victims of
          sexual misconduct, and appear to be without a parent/guardian at the
          Park, then the Park will seek to contact the parents by phone, but
          will likely contact the appropriate law enforcement authorities and
          will also adhere to any mandatory-reporting laws, if any apply.

          <strong>Unruly Behavior.</strong> “Horseplay” in any amusement or
          water Park setting can be dangerous to you and to those around you.
          Accordingly, all manner of “horseplay” is prohibited, including
          without limitation, jumping over any objects (benches, fences), diving
          or jumping into water structures, climbing on trees or structures
          (buildings, lamp posts, etc.), standing on tables or chairs, climbing
          up or jumping over barricades and fences, wrestling, playing tag or
          chasing each other, throwing items (shoes, food, rocks, sticks, rafts
          or inner tubes, etc.), jumping down stairs, twirling around banisters,
          gymnastics-like activities (kart wheels, flips, splits, handstands,
          etc.), or any sports-like activity (throwing a football or Frisbee
          across crowds, kicking a soccer ball around the Park, etc.). Please
          walk through the Park (no running), stay on the walkways, and always
          watch where you are going. Refrain from entering any landscaped
          areas—landscaped and planted areas such as flower beds are not meant
          for guests to tread upon! Exercise caution when going up or down
          stairs, or when traversing any areas with tree roots.

            Medical Marijuana? Marijuana is strictly prohibited on premises,
            whether in the Park or in the parking lots, or anywhere else on, in,
            or around, Park grounds. If you have a medical marijuana card, this
            does NOT entitle you to have marijuana on Park grounds. Anyone in
            possession of marijuana, or using marijuana, will be ejected from
            the Park.

            Electronic Cigarettes? No electronic cigarettes are allow in the

            such devices, nor whether such a device is actually for “smoking”
            and not a weapon or some other sort of device. Minimally, electronic
            cigarettes are annoying and/or a concern to the majority of our
