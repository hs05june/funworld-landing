            When User uses this website, Funworld collects and stores their
            personal information. Funworld&#39;s primary goal to collect such
            information is to provide the User a safe, efficient, smooth, and
            customized experience. This allows Funworld to provide services and
            features that most likely meet User needs, and to customize this
            website to make their experience safer and easier. In general, User
            can browse the website without revealing any personal information
            about them. Once User gives Funworld their personal information,
            User is not anonymous. Wherever possible, Funworld will indicate the
            fields required and optional. Users always have the option to not
            provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or
            feature on the website. User may provide Funworld a user ID.
          </li>
          <li>
            Funworld may automatically track certain information about User
            based on their behavior while accessing its website. This
            information is collected for internal research on the users&#39;
            demographics, interests, and behavior to understand, protect, and
            serve the users of this website better. This information is compiled
            and analyzed on an aggregated basis.

          <li>
            This information may include but is not limited to the URL that User
            just came from (whether this URL is on Funworld website or not),
            which URL User next goes to (whether this URL is on Funworld website

          <li>
            Funworld uses data collection devices such as “cookies” on certain
            pages of the website to help analyze the web page flow, measure
            promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. A “cookie”
            is a small piece of information stored by a web server on a web
            browser to later read back from that browser on User&#39;s system.
            The cookies do not contain any of User&#39;s personally identifiable
            information. Cookies are useful for enabling the browser to remember
            information specific to a given user.
          </li>
          <li>
            Funworld offers certain features that are only available through the
            use of “cookies”. Use of cookies also requires using User&#39;s
            password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us
            provide information that interests User. Most cookies are “session
            cookies,” meaning that they are automatically deleted from
            User&#39;s hard drive at the end of a session. User is always free
            to decline these cookies if their browser permits, although in that
            case User may not be able to use certain features on the website and
            may be required to re-enter their password more frequently during a
            session.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additionally, User may encounter “cookies” or other similar devices
            on certain pages of the website that are placed by third parties.
            Funworld does not control the use of cookies by third parties.
          </li>
          <li>
            If User chooses to buy on the website, Funworld will collect
            information about User&#39;s buying behavior. If User transacts with
            Funworld, it will collect some additional information, such as a
            billing address, a credit/debit card number, and a credit/debit card
            expiration date, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            If User chooses to post messages on Funworld message boards, chat
            rooms, or other message areas or leave feedback, Funworld will
            collect all such information User provides to it. Funworld retains
            this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer
            support, and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law.

            If User sends personal correspondence, such as e-mails or letters,

            about User activities or postings on the website, Funworld may
            collect such information into a file specific to the User. Funworld

            and services, inform User about online and offline offers, products,

            of collection of information. Funworld continually endeavors to
            improve its product and service offerings; it collects and analyzes
            demographic and profile data about the users&#39; activity on this
            website. Funworld identifies and uses User&#39;s IP address to help
            diagnose problems with its server and to administer the website.
            User&#39;s IP address is also used to help identify User and to
            gather broad demographic information.

            Funworld may occasionally ask User to complete optional online
            surveys. These surveys may ask for User&#39;s contact information
            and demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level).
            Funworld uses this data to tailor User&#39;s experience on its

            be interested in and to display content according to User&#39;s
