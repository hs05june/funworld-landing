                        When User uses this website, Funworld collects and stores their personal information. Funworld&#39;s primary goal to collect such information is to provide the User a safe, efficient, smooth, and customized experience. This allows Funworld to provide services and features that most likely meet User needs, and to customize this website to make their experience safer and easier. In general, User can browse the website without revealing any personal information about them. Once User gives Funworld their personal information, User is not anonymous. Wherever possible, Funworld will indicate the fields required and optional. Users always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the website. User may provide Funworld a user ID.

                        Funworld may automatically track certain information about User based on their behavior while accessing its website. This information is collected for internal research on the users&#39; demographics, interests, and behavior to understand, protect, and serve the users of this website better. This information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.

                        Funworld uses data collection devices such as “cookies” on certain pages of the website to help analyze the web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. A “cookie” is a small piece of information stored by a web server on a web browser to later read back from that browser on User&#39;s system. The cookies do not contain any of User&#39;s personally identifiable information. Cookies are useful for enabling the browser to remember information specific to a given user.

                        Funworld offers certain features that are only available through the use of “cookies”. Use of cookies also requires using User&#39;s password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that interests User. Most cookies are “session cookies,” meaning that they are automatically deleted from User&#39;s hard drive at the end of a session. User is always free to decline these cookies if their browser permits, although in that case User may not be able to use certain features on the website and may be required to re-enter their password more frequently during a session.
