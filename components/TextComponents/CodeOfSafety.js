          people may be excluded or removed from certain rides, attractions,

          This may include, but is not limited to, concerns with sight-disabled
          people who need adequate eyesight to safely engage in an activity,
          height and weight restrictions, mobility and/or use and existence of
          all limbs in a stable and coordinated manner, a clear and alert mind
          which is unaffected by mental disability or other hindrance, being
          under the influence of any substances (whether legal or illegal, drugs
          or medications, alcohol, or any other chemicals and substances), signs
          of heat illness, any loose headwear or clothing or apparel which may

            <span className="font-bold">Pay Attention.</span> Please watch where
            you are going. Amusement parks are crowded places with many
            distractions, elevations in surfaces, landscaping, tree roots,
            rocks, man-made structures, patron possessions left lying around the
            park or in pathways, etc; this is the open, obvious and inherent
            nature of an amusement or water park environment. As such, the park
            disclaims all liability, and shall not be held liable in any manner
            whatsoever, for any trip, slip, and/or fall you and/or any minor(s)
            in your care may suffer, Nor for ANY INJURIES CAUSED FROM walking OR
            STUMBLING into objects or structures, OR FALLING OVER OBJECTS OR
            STRUCTURES. By entering the park, you automatically agree to this
            waiver of all such liability.

            headwear, scarves, long belts, fringed materials, high heels, loose
            footwear, wigs, purses, backpacks, or any dangling fabric. If you

            slip-ons, etc.), realize that you are creating a hazard for yourself

            attractions. We urge you to wear secure, comfortable footwear.

            Parking lots are, by their very nature, hazardous places where you

            persons, etc.). Please drive slowly and carefully at all times
            (including into and out of parking spaces, or when entering or
            exiting the lot), realizing that children may be running about, that
            elderly or disabled may not hear or see your car, etc. The park
            shall not be liable for theft, break-ins, car collisions or other
            property damage, and the park has zero liability for anything

          WARNING! Assess Your Capabilities BEFORE You “Just Do It”
        </p>

        <p>
          Rides and other attractions at the Park can provide our guests with
          wonderful memories and exhilarating fun! But amusement and water rides
          also can be adrenaline-pumping activities which put substantial strain
          and forces on your body and senses, through rapid acceleration, speed,
          sudden movements, and the unpredictable motion of a ride, which may
          thrust your body about in different directions, causing muscular
          strain and stress on your body such as on your neck and back, and
          accelerated heart rate and blood pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Do Not Participate in Any Ride, Activity or Attraction, if You Are
          Under the Influence of Any Alcohol, Drugs (Whether Legal Medication or
          Illegal Substances) or Other Substances Which May Affect Your Health,
          Senses, and Body Reflexes and Coordination.
        </p>

        <p>
          Do Not Participate in Any Ride, Activity or Attraction, if You Have
          Any Health Conditions or Pre-existing Conditions or Injuries, or if
          You Are Too Afraid to Participate, Including Without Limitation Heart,
          Nerve, Muscle, Back, Neck, Bone, Joint, Brain, Eye, Ear, or Other
          Ailment or Injury, or if You Are Pregnant or Have Had Surgery in the
          Past Few Months or if You Are Still Recovering From Any Illness or
          Medical Condition, Treatment or Procedure. Only You Can Determine if
          You Feel Good Enough to Safely Participate in a Ride or Attraction.
          The Park Does Not, and Cannot, Guarantee Your Health, and You Fully
          Assume All Risks of Any Park Ride or Activity in Which You Choose to
          Participate.
