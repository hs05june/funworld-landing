                <p>
                    The Park strives to make your experience a happy one, in all respects. Unfortunately, there is no way that we can erase the wicked intent of some people. Therefore, please understand that the Park cannot, and does not, guarantee your personal security or that of your personal property (even if placed in a locker), and in no event will the Park be held liable for your lost, stolen or damaged possessions. If you need to store your possessions, ask the Park about lockers. If you have loose items while wanting to go on a ride, please have a friend or family member hold them or put such possessions in a locker.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is the unfortunate truth that at any amusement park, or at any place in society, no amount of security can prevent people from acting in a criminal manner if they are intent on so acting. The Park can only try to reasonably watch over the premises and the people therein, and respond in a professional manner to any security threat or incident.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you experience a security issue, please notify Park staff; we are here to assist you.
                </p>
