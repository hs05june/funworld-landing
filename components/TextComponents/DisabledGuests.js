              Welcome! Our goal is to accommodate our guests with disabilities
              to the fullest extent possible and in compliance with the law.
              Most of our attractions and restaurants are accessible to guests
              with disabilities, including, among others, those using
              wheelchairs.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            If you (or someone you are responsible for) have a particular
            disability or special need, we encourage you to contact the Park and
            speak with a guest service associate at least 48 hours in advance of
            your visit to better assist us in preparing for your visit. If you
            have a group of disabled persons, a week advance notice would
            greatly help us to better serve you.
          </li>

            Note that the Park does NOT provide medicine, insulin, Epi pens or
            oxygen tanks, or other medical treatments or devices, other than
            basic first aid; please plan your visit accordingly.

            While the Park complies with local and state disability and
            accommodation laws, there may be some rides or attractions,
            activities, or areas of the Park, which may not be safely accessible
            to all persons. At the Park, safety is the only consideration that
            takes precedence over fun! Thrill rides, by their nature, create
            forces and speeds that may not be acceptable or tolerable to some
            guests and may cause injury to some riders with known or unknown
            pre-existing conditions. For your protection, many of the rides and
            other attractions at the Park incorporate safety systems that are
            designed to accommodate people with certain characteristics, such as
            average physical stature and body proportion. These safety systems
            may place restrictions on the ability of certain individuals to
            safely experience an attraction.
          </li>
          <li>
            In general, you should only engage in activities or rides, or
            participate in certain attractions, if you are in good health and
            believe that you can safely do so, and only then if you are not
            under the influence of any drugs or alcohol or other substances
            which may impair your judgment or ability to safely enjoy a ride or
            activity. Do not ride if you know or suspect that you may be
            pregnant, have high blood pressure or other heart condition, neck,
            back/spine or body problems, motion sickness or balance issues,
            recent surgery, neurological or vision disorders, conditions
            affecting coordination and muscle control, seizures or fainting
            spells, or any other medical condition that may affect your ability
            to fully enjoy the activity or ride in a safe and controlled manner
            You should not ride if you have any impairment or condition that
            would prevent the intended use of seating and safety restraints as
            provided, or an inability to follow any safety requirement.

            <strong>
              Prosthetics, Medical Devices & Ride Safety – Not Permitted.
            </strong>{" "}
            For your safety and the safety of others, riders with medical
            devices will be prohibited from certain rides (e.g., a cast, or a
            back brace). Please keep in mind that most amusement or water rides
            generate forces upon the body, and are therefore or not suitable for
            people with existing injuries. In other instances, riders may be
            required to remove medical devices, including half or full-length
            orthotics, braces, crutches, canes, prosthetics and any other type
            of medical assistance device that is not permanently affixed to the
            rider’s body.
          </li>
          <li>
            These rules are necessary to prevent serious hazards associated with
            medical devices or prosthetics coming loose—which can result in
            serious or severe injuries to the rider or other persons. These
            devices may also cause damage to a ride. These devices may also
            prevent safety restraints from working as designed, may present
            hazards with a rider getting in or out of a ride, and interfere with
            the rider’s ability to maintain a securely safe and proper riding
            position. We cannot rely on assurances that “my prosthetic won’t
            come off” — there is absolutely no means for the Park to verify the
            reality of that assurance on a case-by-case basis, or to ensure that
            a prosthetic is so securely attached that it won’t detach during a
            particular ride experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please speak to a Park manager with any questions or for further
            clarification on a ride-by-ride basis. If permitted on a ride
            without the prosthetic device, we ask that you have a friend or
            family member take possession of the device while you enjoy a ride;
            if that is not possible, we will try our best to assist you by
            retaining the device until you have enjoyed your ride
            (notwithstanding, please understand that we are not a “bailee” and
            we cannot assume responsible for any devices, nor shall we incur
            liability for theft, loss or damage).
          </li>
          <li>
            In addition, please understand that there are some rides where the
            existence of all limbs may be necessary in order for you to be
            safely restrained. In such situations, for everyone’s safety, we
            regret that we cannot allow any such person to go on those rides.
