                        Welcome! Our goal is to accommodate our guests with disabilities to the fullest extent possible and in compliance with the law. Most of our attractions and restaurants are accessible to guests with disabilities, including, among others, those using wheelchairs.                    </span>

                    If you (or someone you are responsible for) have a particular disability or special need, we encourage you to contact the Park and speak with a guest service associate at least 48 hours in advance of your visit to better assist us in preparing for your visit. If you have a group of disabled persons, a week advance notice would greatly help us to better serve you.

                    Note that the Park does NOT provide medicine, insulin, Epi pens or oxygen tanks, or other medical treatments or devices, other than basic first aid; please plan your visit accordingly.

                    While the Park complies with local and state disability and accommodation laws, there may be some rides or attractions, activities, or areas of the Park, which may not be safely accessible to all persons. At the Park, safety is the only consideration that takes precedence over fun! Thrill rides, by their nature, create forces and speeds that may not be acceptable or tolerable to some guests and may cause injury to some riders with known or unknown pre-existing conditions. For your protection, many of the rides and other attractions at the Park incorporate safety systems that are designed to accommodate people with certain characteristics, such as average physical stature and body proportion. These safety systems may place restrictions on the ability of certain individuals to safely experience an attraction.

                </li>
                <li>
                    In general, you should only engage in activities or rides, or participate in certain attractions, if you are in good health and believe that you can safely do so, and only then if you are not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol or other substances which may impair your judgment or ability to safely enjoy a ride or activity. Do not ride if you know or suspect that you may be pregnant, have high blood pressure or other heart condition, neck, back/spine or body problems, motion sickness or balance issues, recent surgery, neurological or vision disorders, conditions affecting coordination and muscle control, seizures or fainting spells, or any other medical condition that may affect your ability to fully enjoy the activity or ride in a safe and controlled manner You should not ride if you have any impairment or condition that would prevent the intended use of seating and safety restraints as provided, or an inability to follow any safety requirement.

                    <strong>Prosthetics, Medical Devices & Ride Safety – Not Permitted.</strong> For your safety and the safety of others, riders with medical devices will be prohibited from certain rides (e.g., a cast, or a back brace). Please keep in mind that most amusement or water rides generate forces upon the body, and are therefore or not suitable for people with existing injuries. In other instances, riders may be required to remove medical devices, including half or full-length orthotics, braces, crutches, canes, prosthetics and any other type of medical assistance device that is not permanently affixed to the rider’s body.

                </li>
                <li>
                    These rules are necessary to prevent serious hazards associated with medical devices or prosthetics coming loose—which can result in serious or severe injuries to the rider or other persons. These devices may also cause damage to a ride. These devices may also prevent safety restraints from working as designed, may present hazards with a rider getting in or out of a ride, and interfere with the rider’s ability to maintain a securely safe and proper riding position. We cannot rely on assurances that “my prosthetic won’t come off” — there is absolutely no means for the Park to verify the reality of that assurance on a case-by-case basis, or to ensure that a prosthetic is so securely attached that it won’t detach during a particular ride experience.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Please speak to a Park manager with any questions or for further clarification on a ride-by-ride basis. If permitted on a ride without the prosthetic device, we ask that you have a friend or family member take possession of the device while you enjoy a ride; if that is not possible, we will try our best to assist you by retaining the device until you have enjoyed your ride (notwithstanding, please understand that we are not a “bailee” and we cannot assume responsible for any devices, nor shall we incur liability for theft, loss or damage).

                </li>
                <li>
                    In addition, please understand that there are some rides where the existence of all limbs may be necessary in order for you to be safely restrained. In such situations, for everyone’s safety, we regret that we cannot allow any such person to go on those rides.
